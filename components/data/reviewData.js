      "Iâ€™ve used them twice now and plan to go back. Both times the repair was quick and got my vehicle back on the road. They even helped pick me up to bring me to the shop to get my vehicle.",

      "My son had a breakdown on the highway on the way from Chicago to school in Boulder. We had the car towed to these guys, and Xray could not have been nicer or more helpful in guiding us through a tough situation. I trust they're good mechanics and I know they're good people. Thanks a million to Zack and company for helping Spencer and I out.",

      "We ran out of oil halfway on our road trip. We called 7 mechanics and none of them helped us out with our emergency. All except these guys. They were super honest, fair priced, and very friendly. I would highly recommend them to anyone in or around the Dixon area.",

      "Quick, easy and very polite. Kept the vehicle overnight to ensure that another problem wouldn't pop up. I will always go back to Xray Auto Repair for my vehicle needs.",
